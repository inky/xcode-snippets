# Xcode Snippets

Some Objective-C code snippets I use in Xcode.

## Using Snippets

[mattt](https://github.com/mattt/Xcode-Snippets) says it best:

> In Xcode 4, open a workspace and toggle the right sidebar to be visible. On
> the bottom, there is a panel with four icons in the header. Click on the
> `{ }` icon to open the Code Snippets Library.
>
> Now copy-paste the code from one of these snippets, highlight the code block
> you just pasted and drag it to the Code Snippet panel. Make sure to match
> the suggested platform, language, and completion scope.

Make sure to match the completion scope that's noted in the comment above the
snippet. The platform is *All* and the language is *Objective-C* unless stated
otherwise.
